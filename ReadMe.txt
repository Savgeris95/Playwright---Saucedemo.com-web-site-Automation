## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create end-to-end automated tests simulating real user scenarios on a web application, aiming to showcase skills relevant for a junior QA automation or software testing role.

## What This Project Does

- Automates user flows such as login, adding/removing items from the cart, sorting products, completing checkout, and logout.
- Implements tests that verify UI elements, user interactions, and business logic.
- Uses Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with a `PageManager` class to organize page interactions.
- Generates HTML reports of test runs.
- Includes CI integration using GitHub Actions to run tests on demand.

- **TypeScript**: for writing test and page object code
- **Faker.js**: to generate realistic random test data
- **GitHub Actions**: for continuous integration and automated test execution
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: to structure the test code cleanly and maintainably
